# Market_segmentation_Macdonal Case Study (individual)
Task: code conversion from R to python for Macdonal case study
Analysing the different market segments(clusters) present in the data to get the best market segment.  
Making use of PCA, KMeans, Global stability plot, Gorge plot, segement level stability within solution and across solution to find the best segment solution.
Using Model based method Gaussian mixture model and distance based model to visualise Information Criteria (AIC, BIC, ICL) to select the best segment solution.

# Team Report on Market Segmentation and Analysis
Task was to study the Market segmentation pdf containing Macdonal Case study and make a note out of it based on our understanding.
